  cite: We rely on TeamPass daily, to securely store and share internal and customer credentials among our staff. The folder/role features mean we can assign a folder per-customer, and delegate R/W management of that folder to accountable engineers, while other engineers get R/O access as required. The simplicity of the app (PHP and MySQL) means it fits in well with other proven tools in our production (CentOS6) environment. The usefulness of the app far outweighs the minor UI issues, which improve with every release.

  cite: When I first came to my company, it was like WestWorld with regards to password management.; anything goes. Since we've rolled out TeamPass throughout the org, it not only makes it easy to share passwords,  but staff members always know where to go to get the latest password. This takes a lot of the pain/frustration out of rotating passwords and enforcing strong password standards, which is often a barrier to good password hygiene. If you make it easy to share passwords your users will adopt it.When I

  cite: We are a small charity based company and being able to use a product that is fully secure and internal ticked all the boxes for us. After installing Teampass and trailing multiple other applications for the last 6 months. I can say teampass is by far the best option for us. It’s easy to use, simple to manage and requires little support once running. After experiencing  some minor issues with best practices, config and a lack of knowledge of the program, I contacted the support team for advice and expected no response as we are using it for free. I was given first class remote support and now understand the system a lot better thanks to Nils. I was also given advice on best practices and was fully supported through rectifying the issues I had experienced thanks to my own bad habits and mistakes. We now only have one password storage application and its teampass. I would highly recommend this product for IT support team password management. We will be rolling it out to other depts over the next year and will be using it as part of our BCP and disaster recovery plans.Great product.

  cite: Our team uses TeamPass daily managing thousands of accounts. It works well, it keeps our passwords secure, and we don’t have to worry about working around all of the exposures other hosted solutions have to deal with on a regular basis. The guys at TeamPass are continually upgrading the software and improving it. When we have needed support the forums have been excellent, but their team has been even better.

  cite: Nous utilisons TEAMPASS depuis plusieurs années et nous n’avons à ce jour pas trouvé d’outils remplissant à la fois les fonctions de partage d’une même base de données, catégorisation des droits/accès, multi-utilisateurs. D’autre part, l’outil TEAMPASS a répondu aux exigences de la RGPD (validé par notre DPO), de l’ISO27001 (validé par nos auditeurs), de l’ISO9001 (validé par nos auditeurs) et nos commissaires aux comptes. Nous challengeons tous les 2 ans cette solution en assurant une veille sur les produits du marché sans avoir trouvé à ce jour une solution répondant à nos critères. Détail ultime, cette solution pouvant être installée sur un environnement dédié, elle est donc locale et répond facilement au problème des solutions hébergées, pas toujours faciles à localiser. Pour ce qui douterait du service, nous maintenons cette solution active car elle ne souffre depuis que nous l’utilisons, d’aucun bug, et dispose d’un niveau de services tout à fait acceptable via le site www.teampass.net.
